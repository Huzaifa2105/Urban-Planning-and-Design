### ⚙️ Workflow Overview
1.	Data Collection
Gather urban datasets (traffic, land use, population) from open data sources.
2.	Data Processing & Analysis
Use Python libraries to clean, process, and visualize trends.
3.	Mobility Simulation
Implement SUMO to simulate traffic conditions and study bottlenecks.
4.	3D Urban Visualization
Build a simple 3D model to visually represent the urban design proposal.
5.	Optimization & Presentation
Analyse outcomes, refine the plan, and present results via visuals and reports.
